He's just not a dominant stuff guy anymore, showing elite pitchability and getting outs by outsmarting hitters rather than overpowering them. He uses his two breaking balls to change the hitter's eye level, often pitching backward and starting hitters with breaking balls to get to the fastball later in the plate appearance. Sometimes became too predictable, with hitters taking big cuts on first pitch curves.



His fastball-curve-slider combination is major-league quality, with only consistency and command potentially holding him back. Whether or not his changeup will develop enough to get opposite-handed hitters out enough is an open question. There's also a question of whether or not getting his lower half more engaged might lead to more velocity, or if it would undo some of the command gains he's seen.



Giolito brings a maturity to the mound that is clearly evident as he works. He works methodically, setting hitters up with purpose pitches, to maximize the effectiveness of pitches later in the plate appearance. His margin for error is much lower than it once was, but he seems to have bridged that gap with a more cerebral approach. Right now Giolito is a likely mid-rotation starter, and at 23 years old there's reason to think he can still improve. The ceiling just isn't quite as high as it once was.","Big body; stands tall on mound; athletic build; above average arm speed; high-three-quarters slot; arm stab; long extension to plate; minimal activation of lower half; controlled, easy delivery; loses some balance out of stretch; moderate-high leg kick.","60","FA","70","92-94","null","null","Big body; stands tall on mound; athletic build; above average arm speed; high-three-quarters slot; arm stab; long extension to plate; minimal activation of lower half; controlled, easy delivery; loses some balance out of stretch; moderate-high leg kick.","null","70","60","50","null","60","60","50","40","null"

His body is not one that’s typically built to last 200 innings a year, and his velocity a couple years after Tommy John surgery still isn’t anywhere close to some pre-injury reports I’ve seen. The natural stuff adds up to a fringe-average package highlighted by what projects to be an excellent change-up with good drop and an advanced feel for consistent execution. But he’s developed a loose, repeatable delivery that utilizes his positive assets (length and flexibility) well, and he gets around at least some of the limited strength by generating strong downhill momentum with a rhythmic pendulum push off the rubber.



There’s an intelligence evident in his approach, but his size and average fastball leave him little margin for error as he develops. His breaking ball’s lack of projection makes it tough to project a useful bullpen niche as a fallback. He’ll need to be able to consistently work off 60 or better command if he’s going to have a shot as a starter, and while the mechanics suggest that’s not an impossible or even unlikely outcome, it’s also a volatile profile with a ceiling limited to the back end of a rotation.

Went 97 with sink, glove side, outside corner black for strike 1. The same exact pitch for strike 2. Then wipe out CB that started in the middle of the plate, ended down and away and Gary Sanchez started his swing but had no prayer.



Sanchez is a top prospect in the Blue Jays system and rightfully so. His stuff is electric and when the command is plus he is deadly. He'll need to get more consistent with his mechanics and command but he is near ready for the majors leagues. Some more refinement is in the works for Sanchez and despite being in AA, there is some gap from now and his future.","Listed at 6'4"" 200, which is probably close to accurate.

His build is ideal for a starter, with a tall frame that generates a good downward plane with an easy delivery. He can stand to add a little weight in his lower half in order to handle the rigors of 200 innings a year, but is otherwise ideally built to be a starter.



Gsellman should fit nicely in the middle of a big league rotation, and even if the change-up never reaches its average potential, the curveball gives him a weapon to combat left-handed hitters.

That gives him an extremely high ceiling, but his lack of fastball command makes the gap between present and future ability still quite large. The curveball is currently far ahead of the fastball in terms of in-game utility, and he leans on the pitch when he struggles to throw the fastball for strikes. His mechanics aren't the issue, as he has the ability to repeat his delivery when he remains under control. His biggest present issue is a strong tendency to overthrow. Simply put, Reyes likes throwing hard and adds effort to his delivery in order to do so. That effort is unnecessary, as he generates plenty of velocity without it, and it throws off his mechanics and release point. This tendency is not nearly as evident when he throws his curveball.



The command of his fastball will ultimately determine what kind of starter he can become, or whether or not he can remain one at all. If he can't, he should have no trouble becoming a dominant two-pitch late-inning reliever. If he can gain even average fastball command, he will be able to remain in a big league rotation and if enough progress is made, he could lead one. Even without the development of a third pitch, two plus offerings should be enough to remain a starter. The fastball command will have to improve, however, in order for him to avoid a fate as a reliever.","Good body control, athletic, gathers well at top of delivery; electric arm, plus arm speed; clean mechanics, some shortness on takeaway; good extension towards plate; high 3/4 release point; repeats delivery well when he stays under control and doesn't overthrow; some effort in delivery when he overthrows, but not every time.","55","Fastball","70","96-98","null","null","Good body control, athletic, gathers well at top of delivery; electric arm, plus arm speed; clean mechanics, some shortness on takeaway; good extension towards plate; high 3/4 release point; repeats delivery well when he stays under control and doesn't overthrow; some effort in delivery when he overthrows, but not every time.","null","70","45","null","null","55","55","40","null","null"

It's important that they let him marinate in Double-A until he refines his approach even more so and finds some consistent success. It was very simple to beat him early on. Fastball outer-half; then slider/curve outer-half and then off the plate to get him to chase. The hit tool did not grade out well in the first couple of looks, but the bat speed was evident, and as the season went on he started knocking balls out of the park with more regularity. Adjustments were made; he showed the ability to spit on pitches that he was chasing early and attack pitches in the zone more often. His power is tied to the hit tool, of course, and in order for him to become a game-changing bat he needs to continue to adjust to the pitchers tendencies. 



Hitters hit, and Renfroe did enough mashing to get to Double-A at the all-star break. He's struggling a little now, which could be just adjusting to the level and getting a feel (which he seemed to do well in High-A), so I'd keep him there the rest of this season and the majority of next before seeing what he can do at the major league level.","Big man strength; imposing size; heavier than listed weight; thick legs and rear; plenty of muscle up top as well; very good athlete; major league body; he's what a RF should look like.","High","2016","60","50; League-Average Right Fielder","Primary Position: RF","null","Big man strength; imposing size; heavier than listed weight; thick legs and rear; plenty of muscle up top as well; very good athlete; major league body; he's what a RF should look like.","Slightly open stance; rocks at the plate; looks very comfortable; extremely strong hands/wrists; clears his hips well; unleashes the bat with authority; uppercut stroke with leverage; swing is short and compact for a power bat; bat speed is plus; loves fastballs; approach was questionable early; hyper-aggressive; in early looks, he sat fastball all game and was fooled by change of speed and spin; out on his front foot; made some adjustments; better swings/takes vs. quality off-speed; swing and miss will always be a part of his game; I like the outlook because of his improved approach, bat speed, and strength.","Raw power is plus-plus; overall strength flows through the bat well; his BP was a home run show; shows power to the opposite field; uppercut swing creates leverage and balls have a ton of carry; game power is present; hit two home runs in my looks, one on a spinning slider and one on a fastball on the inner-half; hits a ton of fly balls which bears well for his power output; hit tool needs to reach close to an average level for power to flow.","Clocked 4.46; shut it down the last step; moves well in the outfield; corner profile; better runner when he gets a head of steam; present below average; will settle slightly lower as he gets older.","Athleticism allows him to get some good breaks in RF; routes are solid; range is about average but once he gets going he can move well; makes all the routine plays; above-average coordination should allow him to become an plus defender down the line.","Arm is a weapon; gets behind the throw; threw a guy out at the plate from medium-deep RF, but the catcher couldn't handle the ball; will play in either corner.","50","65","35","55","60"

Regarding his passive approach at the plate, DeShields himself said the Astros as an organization want him to take a lot of pitches every time he leads off an inning, so that could explain a lot in that aspect of his game.","Stocky build; big upper body for being a relatively short player; former running back in high school; plenty of strength; had ankle wrapped prior to the game on 7/1/13, stated he was fine.","High","2016","55","","Primary Position: 2B","null","Stocky build; big upper body for being a relatively short player; former running back in high school; plenty of strength; had ankle wrapped prior to the game on 7/1/13, stated he was fine.","Simple, balanced stance; flat-planed swing designed for contact; quick trigger allows him to let the ball travel deep into the zone; plus bat speed; good hands; swing oriented to hit the ball up the middle and the other way; strength helps him fight off better velocity; tracks off-speed extremely well for the level; may have the best eye in the Cal League; can get out on his front foot on occasion; shortens up with two strikes even more; approach is already advanced; the potential is there, but hitters hit and I’d like to see him swing the bat a little more often.","Strong bat; swing mechanics aren’t designed for power, however; due to his solid upper body, may be able to muscle a few out to his pull side at the highest level; will rack up the doubles and triples because of solid gap approach and pure 80 speed; over-the-fence power will never be a big part of his game.","3.7 on a jailbreak bunt; didn’t go all out to first on any regular groundballs; getting caught stealing a lot more this season which could be due to better catchers or simply bad jumps; has an awesome second gear, especially going first to third and second to home; recently stole home while the pitcher was intentionally walking a batter; plus athlete allows plus-plus speed projection for many years.","Well below average with the glove at present; hasn’t shown feel for the position; while he’s lightning fast, he could be a little stiff for the position and needs to work on his agility; range is just okay; gets to some tough plays; footwork can get a little out of whack; can stab at the ball with his glove on even some routine plays; depending on how he matures physically in his prime, he may need to move off of the position, possibly to CF; needs to lean out a little bit if he wants to stick.

The fastball explodes out of his hand, with excellent movement, and the velocity is generated incredibly easy.  The pitch gets on hitters quickly to produce late swings.  When Sanchez broke out his curveball in this outing, it showed teeth, bite, and depth.  He knows how to snap the pitch off with tight rotation, along with how to vary shape and still keep a consistent release.  While the changeup was used sparingly, it flashed some quality action a couple of times.  This arsenal has the potential to be electric.



The big concern here is the fastball command and lack of control.  It was downright ugly in this outing.  Early on, Sanchez got through things with some timely executed fastballs despite not throwing many strikes.  The second time through the lineup, however, he was not so lucky, and absolutely labored through the third inning, getting hit hard via his fastball in the process.  The movement and 93-95 mph velocity were no match for failed execution, and the outing ended abruptly after that inning.



Based on this outing, there's a lot of work to go with reeling his fastball in.  Right now, I don't see this gap being fully closed to where Sanchez achieves a career profile that matches the shine of his stuff.  I feel the pitcher can improve with his command and control via repetition, but the inconsistency of this aspect of his game is something he's always likely going to have to battle.  Sanchez's delivery leaves something to be desired when it comes to finishing and throwing downhill.  



I see Sanchez as having a good chance at becoming big league starter, and when locked in, there can be some dominant stretches.  But, my feel is that the pitcher will be inconsistent enough that it's an uneven body of work.","3/4 arm slot; upright delivery; not a lot of lower body used; lacks finish; loose thrower - ball explodes out of hand; easy, efficient delivery; fast arm; generates easy velocity; can overthrow out of the stretch; lands square towards home; short stride.","60","Fastball","60","93-95","null","null","3/4 arm slot; upright delivery; not a lot of lower body used; lacks finish; loose thrower - ball explodes out of hand; easy, efficient delivery; fast arm; generates easy velocity; can overthrow out of the stretch; lands square towards home; short stride.","null","70","50","null","null","60","70","45","null","null"

His fastball was all over the place, and he labored to get through the first two innings.  The quality of his curveball was apparent from the beginning however.  The pitch was crisp, with strong two-plane break and the pitcher had very little problem throwing it for strikes.  The offering carried the righty past his early struggles.  I point this out because once the third inning rolled around Sanchez's fastball emerged for the rest of the outing.  It was almost like a switch flipped.  The pitch was consistently spotted down in the zone and on the corners, leaving opposing hitters little chance of doing much with the offering due to the movement and velocity.



I liked the way Sanchez continued to battle in this outing, and didn't give up on trying to throw his heater.  It could have been easy to continue to lean on his curveball.  It also speaks to the quality of the offering that it got him through a difficult stretch.  The grades are more than warranted for me as this pitch can get big-league hitters out right now on a consistent basis.  The long pole here is the fastball.  There's a Jekyll and Hyde nature to it.  The movement and way the velocity plays because of it are a big ingredient for thinking about a front-line projection, but the inconsistent command holds that back.



This arm is athletic, young, and loose, which is usually a good indication that command growth can occur.  The delivery isn't the most fluid, though, when it comes to staying above the baseball on a consistent basis.  There's very little lower half incorporation and leverage created.  I don't see it progressing past ""area command"" because of that.  There is a decent sized present gap for the pitcher to reach the projection, but I see it as achievable.","3/4 arm slot; easy, efficient delivery; generates velocity via loose arm; short stride; struggles repeating delivery in stretches; tends to overthrow - speeds up delivery during second half; doesn't use frame well to stay on top of fastball; much more comfortable delivering curveball; quick to plate. but yo-yo's with pace; 1.28-1.39 out of stretch.","60","Fastball","65","92-95","null","null","3/4 arm slot; easy, efficient delivery; generates velocity via loose arm; short stride; struggles repeating delivery in stretches; tends to overthrow - speeds up delivery during second half; doesn't use frame well to stay on top of fastball; much more comfortable delivering curveball; quick to plate. but yo-yo's with pace; 1.28-1.39 out of stretch.","null","70","55","null","null","60","65","45","null","null"

Schwarber's long-term home isn't behind the plate, but he can handle the responsibility for the time being, perhaps even catching everyday during the early part of his career. He'll always be below average behind the plate, but he's capable enough to remain back there for the time being given the asset that his offensive production would be from that position.



A realistic scenario could see the Cubs using him in the majors the same way they are using him in the minors, where he is catching a few days a week while splitting time in the outfield. That would allow his bat to continue to be an asset while keeping him from being over-exposed at the position.



Overall, the bat is going to have to carry Schwarber no matter where he ends up.

The outing had me blown away and left me believing he is the most talented player in this year's draft class.



He began this outing as a two-pitch pitcher, using his vicious fastball and curveball combination before mixing in a changeup and cutter, ultimately working backwards before exiting in the midst of a no-hitter (passed ball on a strikeout) once he hit his low pitch count limit. He can get over any of his secondary offerings for quality strikes, and double down on them, then freeze hitters by running a mid-90s fastball in on their hands. This kind of aptitude and understanding of pitching is an excellent quality for anyone to have, but it makes hitting against him a daunting task.



He won't struggle against the high school hitters he is currently facing, but he could be getting out minor league hitters right now due to the aforementioned reasons. In regards to the arsenal, it consists of a potential plus-plus fastball-curveball combination, 60-grade changeup, and a cutter to mix in. All of this is coming out of the left hand of an player whom possesses a 6'4"" body to dream on and a clean delivery that will allow for at least plus command in the future. To round it off, the player's shown great makeup and mound presence throughout his time in the spotlight.","High three-quarters slot; starts from the middle of the rubber; works through all quadrants of the zone; creates angle and downhill plane; perfect pitcher's body; 15 pounds to add on; plus athlete; plus command profile; plus makeup; athletic delivery; high leg kick; long stride; drives off of the rubber; stays balanced; incorporates entire body into the delivery; compact arm action; loose, strong arm; hides the ball well; doesn't rush; difficult to nitpick anything.","60","Fastball","70","92","null","null","High three-quarters slot; starts from the middle of the rubber; works through all quadrants of the zone; creates angle and downhill plane; perfect pitcher's body; 15 pounds to add on; plus athlete; plus command profile; plus makeup; athletic delivery; high leg kick; long stride; drives off of the rubber; stays balanced; incorporates entire body into the delivery; compact arm action; loose, strong arm; hides the ball well; doesn't rush; difficult to nitpick anything.","null","70","60","50","null","60","60","50","30","null"

His fastball velocity should allow him to miss bats and his command of it doesn't have too far to go to be truly effective. His curveball will be effective against lefties, and he's comfortable throwing it to right-handed hitters to keep them honest.

His mechanics have been refined from previous reports to the point where they really help his stuff play up. He repeats his delivery well and there is little effort in the motion.

He needs to throw strikes with his fastball for his change-up to have a chance of keeping him in the rotation-- he will require pitcher's counts to use the pitch. The CB can be used in any count and will aid strikeout totals when the FB command is good enough to put Fried in 2-strike counts.

He is still very raw and is very much in the middle of the transition from thrower to pitcher. He does, however, show glimpse of being a player who is succeeding at that transition. The arm is fantastic, and generates premium velocity with ease. His slider is still quite raw, but he generates good spin and movement with the pitch. Once he learns to command it better, it can be a second plus pitch.



For Tuivailala, however, that's it. He has no off-speed pitch and could struggle against left-handed hitters if he doesn't come up with something to combat them - perhaps a cutter. That said, he does have the ability to miss bats that could allow him to pitch in late innings. If he doesn't develop something to throw to lefties, he'll settle in is an effective right-handed specialist, but even a show-me offering against off-handed hitters could be enough to allow him to pitch late in games.","Lightning quick arm, short on the back half, some drop in his arm action but brings it back up quickly.

Fought to snap off the pitch during start; changeup has evolved into viable offering, with less firmness.

Overall, project Barnes as a solid third or fourth starter at the major-league level, as arsenal is currently constructed. Potential for more due to feel there is future growth with curveball. Barnes’ curve flashed solid-average-to-plus break, but needs repetition locking into consistent arm slot. Tended to speed up at the end of delivery when throwing, to lose balance. Presently, he is not pressed to deepen pitch sequences due to caliber of fastball and ability to command/control offering against competition. More advanced hitters will force Barnes to either improve execution of secondary offerings or stagnate towards reaching ceiling. Present stuff is good enough to reach big leagues. Still building stamina; although Barnes was not taxed in the outing, velocity started to drop after 65 pitches. The pitcher has the body and delivery to log 200-plus innings.

There is a lot of upside with him and the tools he possesses.  His track record shows that he can get the job done and is doing so this year as well.  Moving forward, his command of fastball and development of offspeed pitches must progress.  However, this only comes with experience and more hours spent refining mechanics and repetoire in bullpen sessions.  He has a great tenacity out on the mound and a very good command of the game for his age.  He mixes pickoffs well to first with different looks.  He is slow for his release time (1.41-1.90) but for a lefty that's not too worrisome.  I'd like to see him throw fewer pitches per inning and learn to attack the zone early.  He has the type of fastball where he doesn't need to pick the corners, he can throw it middle and let his sharp angles and deception do the work.  He will need to create some repeatability mechanically but that always comes with age.  Working at a slower more controlled tempo and creating more drive off backside would allow for better command of pitches.

He has tremendous raw power, but he doesn't approach his at-bats that way. Instead, he features an up-the-middle approach and a patient eye at the plate. Because of this, he doesn't have the typical issues that tend to plague bigger hitters - holes in the swing, trouble with premium velocity, etc. This should benefit him in the long run, as he doesn't need to sell out and should still hit for plus power, but will do so without the extreme swing-and-miss.



For now, Judge is an above-average fielder in right field, though that should diminish as he ages. He runs well for his size, but will never be an asset on the bases. Will eventually be a well below-average runner.



The overall package is interesting. Judge doesn't profile as an impact, middle-of-the-order hitter, but he does enough things well that should be an everyday player. If he learns to use his size better and drive the ball with more consistency, however, he could hit for enough power to carry a lineup. More likely, however, is that he settles in as a solid regular who can do a lot of things well but does none of them spectacularly.","Ridiculously large human being, extremely tall (listed at 6'7"") but lean, well built; should age well for a bigger player; athletic, moves well for his size, doesn't look awkward.","Moderate","Late 2015","60","50, first-division regular","Primary Position: RF","null","Ridiculously large human being, extremely tall (listed at 6'7"") but lean, well built; should age well for a bigger player; athletic, moves well for his size, doesn't look awkward.","Starts with hands high, but lowers them as pitch is being delivered; above-average bat speed but not elite; keeps bat in the strike zone for a long time; size and arm length makes his swing long, but he does a good job of staying as short as possible, would be a bigger problem for most hitters his size; two-handed finish helps him stay short; has a short weight transfer and the up the middle approach of a much smaller player; good recognition of off-speed and breaking pitches.","Power is result of size and strength rather than elite bat speed; does not sell out for power or look to drive the ball; will run into home runs because of natural strength; ball jumps off his bat, especially when he gets his arms extended.","Moves well for his size, not a base clogger; speed plays better in the outfield than it does on the bases; slow to get to top speed because of long strides; average runner under way;","Gets good reads off the bat; will have above-average range early in career; good athleticism; not afraid of wall, shows good field awareness; no problem going to the ground for a ball, a problem with many large players; will be an above-average right fielder for a few years until he slows down.","Plus arm, above-average arm strength, enough for RF; arm strength plays up because of plus arm accuracy; gets rid of ball quickly and knows where to go with the ball; arm can be an asset in the field.","55","60","40","55","60"

While Manaea stuff is very legit, I had to remember than commanding the pitches will ultimately allow them to play to their full potential.



Manaea has calmed his delivery down and it is much more simple. His landing spot and arm slot have become more consistent, allowing his command to play up. Over the last 5 games, Manaea walk rate has dropped tremendously and his strikeout numbers have stayed the same. He seems to have adjusted well to High-A and is becoming more of a polished arm. His FB utility is near double-plus due to the movement and velocity of the pitch. His ability to command his pitches now makes me think his secondaries will play up to their full potential.

Coupled with strong velocity and some movement, the fastball along could be enough to get Faria to the big leagues if he can learn to command it more consistently within the strike zone. The secondary pitches trail behind the fastball at this point, but the change-up has a chance to be a good pitch, with diving action that causes hitters to swing over the top of it. The pitch plays up because of the deception caused by his delivery and mechanics, and he should be able to use it effectively against lefties and righties, giving him a good chance to remain a starter. The curveball is more of a show-me pitch, but he throws it for strikes enough to keep it in hitter's minds and when down in the zone, it can generate ground balls.



The key for Faria will be fastball command. He throws strikes but he needs to throw better ones. When down in the strike zone and on the edges, he can dominate with the fastball alone. If he learns to command the pitch effectively, the fastball/change-up combination will be enough to keep him in the rotation.

This is the type of talent who can develop into an impact player and stick around the league for a while at a premium position. The present flaws are highly noticeable, however, and there is a big gap for him to cover to reach his ceiling. Brinson’s approach is extremely unrefined, leading to a lot of wild swings and a lack of coverage on the outer third of the plate. The 19-year-old’s body language and early weight transfer also indicate a big need for improvement with picking up the spin of breaking balls. While I see his strike zone judgment and pitch recognition as areas that have room for growth with experience, Brinson presently consistently repeats his mistakes and is often up at the plate looking to hit it as far as he can. Early clues that there are some engrained habits to break.

The outfielder’s batspeed and ability to barrel up the ball with authority are good signs that with growth in his secondary skills the bat can end up highly productive. With development, Brinson’s peak offensive output can approach .270s batting averages and 25 home runs annually. The power may crest even further as this is a hitter that can put a charge into a baseball at an early age and understands how to produce backspin, and lift. There is a lot of risk that the hit tool ends up falling short due to his propensity to swing-and-miss and averages are more in the .240s range, leading to him hitting in the bottom third of a first division lineup. The hole down and away, especially with breaking balls, and pull nature to his swing lead me to believe he’ll likely always be able be pitched to. The upside is that Brinson will make pitchers pay for poorly located fastballs or inconsistent execution. The key is how much he can improve with keeping his hands back over the next season or two.

He just turned 20 in January, making him more than three years younger than his average High-A competition. 



It's extremely impressive that he's (more than) held is own at the level, and given the current underdevelopment of his secondary arsenal it's a testament to just how good his raw fastball can be. It's a big league pitch with extremely easy velocity. There's not much in the delivery that suggests he's capable of plus-plus velocity, but he'll routinely bring the pitch with life in the mid-90's. The pitch shows good explosion with the help of modest deception from his uphill motion, and he's able to generate in-zone whiffs against High-A hitters even in dangerous portions of the zone. 



The big question is how much of a secondary arsenal he can develop to support the primary weapon. In two viewings now he hasn't shown anything with even average projection out of his three supporting pitches, and there's only so long in his developmental journey he'll be able to live as heavily off the fastball as he is currently. His curve is a clear fourth on the depth chart right now, but it may ultimately have the best potential to develop into a workable compliment. 



There's ample fire in the belly, and he'll need to corral his emotions a bit better as he matures. The team has been aggressive with Senzatela thus far and he's answered the challenge. He has the look of a future bullpen asset at this point if he can find a 50 in his secondary arsenal, and the Rockies have the luxury of ample time on their side in helping him develop one.","Throws uphill from high 3/4 slot.

He's a physical specimen with a huge arm, plus speed and raw power, and the makings of a solid-average glove in centerfield. The big question remains whether he'll ever hit enough for it to matter. He's attempted to make some adjustments to his setup and swing, but he remains oddly stiff in his setup and launch, and while he's shown improvement in his balance and stride, the barrel delivery remains below-average. If he can find himself a hitting coach that can figure out how to unlock his power and draw out more consistent contact, there remains all-star potential here. As is, he offers enough speed, defense, and nascent game power to profile as a big-leaguer even in spite of a below-average offensive trajectory.","Elite athlete, well-proportioned,mature frame, strength throughout, mild projection remaining, can wear additional muscle into maturity without compromising physicality","Moderate","2019","55","45: 4th OF","Primary Position: CF","null","Elite athlete, well-proportioned,mature frame, strength throughout, mild projection remaining, can wear additional muscle into maturity without compromising physicality","Swing has undergone some mechanical overhaul this year, still very quiet at setup, starts wider, long stride, more balanced; stiff, minimal load, mechanical stride, gets flat-footed at trigger, creates torque but costs him length into the zone; bat speed pushes plus, explosive wrists, doesn't get a ton out of his legs, will leverage up in hitter's counts; gets bottom hand-heavy, poor barrel control, lots of rollovers, weak infield contact, well above-average swing-and-miss; struggles with off-speed recognition, right-right spin","Plus raw, powerful wrists and shoulders, physicality to damage the baseball; lack of consistent lower-half engagement, poor pitch recognition, generally flat swing plane limit in-game utility; power plays mostly to center/left-center in hitter's count","4.19 average on 8 clocks, efficient stride gets to speed quickly, plays to full utility in the outfield; reads on the bases still raw, some uncertain crossovers on stolen-base attempts; potential to develop into 20-bag threat","Reads are still raw at times, lacks elite pickup off the bat; feel for trajectory, gets to speed quickly, routes are generally efficient, excellent closing speed, controls body pursing balls into the gaps; can struggle going back on balls, physicality to develop above-average utility","Fire hose, plus-plus velocity, low trackers lack a ton of carry at times, but get where they're going very quickly; solid accuracy on the move","40","45","60","55","70"

The fastball flashed plus-plus potential with very good movement and solid command and he paired that with a plus slider. He tired late, his fastball and slider losing some velocity and movement. It appears as if this was not just an aberration- his fastball was a reported 88-91 mph two starts later- and consequently got sent down to extended spring training to ""adjust"" to professional baseball. In my opinion, it is hard to believe he lost that velocity within two starts. There are some questions Appel has failed to answer quite yet: can he bring all three pitches to the table on a given night? Does he care? Even in the start that I witnessed, he wasn't pitching with a purpose. After giving up a home run, he looked nonchalant. It appears to me that he can go through the motions and still find success, but I'm not sure he has that edge that sets elite pitchers apart from their peers. Appel has a high floor and might very well reach that floor in the coming seasons, but a pitcher with these premium tools at his disposal needs to be able to harness them and completely over match his opponent.

His easy delivery makes is possible to see him finding the zone with some frequency, but his size will likely prevent him from ever hitting his spots consistently. The size and stuff all point to starter, but the idea of the stuff bumping a few ticks out of the bullpen is appealing if he never learns to throw enough strikes.

He would profile well behind the plate and has the defensive chops to stick, but his arm is weak and would be exploited behind the plate at the highest level due to a long release and poor pop times. At third base, his arm could play at the fringe-average level, but his defensive chops at third are unrefined and don't project to get better due to a body that's maxed-out physically, hands that are underwhelming, and poor lateral agility. 



All in all, Caratini projects to be a utility player who can play some third, some catcher, and possibly even some first base at the highest level. His bat will be his carrying tool through the minors, but his lack of a true defensive home will limit his impact at the highest level. If a team is willing to punt defense behind the plate (i.e. the running game), he has the ceiling of a second-division regular as his bat would profile well at the position. Things become more complicated if he's developed as a third baseman solely, however, as his bat won't be a profile fit at the hot corner. His ability to smash line drives all over the field, limit a pitcher's platoon advantage, and show a decent approach at the plate will make him valuable in a bench/utility role.","Strong, filled frame; no room for additional mass or physical projection; sloped shoulders; barrel chest; mass in midsection; thick lower half; any additional weight will be of the bad variety.","High","2017","50","45; utility profile (3B/C/1B)","Primary Position: C","Secondary Position: 3B","Strong, filled frame; no room for additional mass or physical projection; sloped shoulders; barrel chest; mass in midsection; thick lower half; any additional weight will be of the bad variety.","Left side: short, compact stroke; simple feet from a slightly open stance; keeps hands connected to his back shoulder during load; quick hips; simple barrel delivery; plus bat speed with loose hands; barrels balls up with ease in all quadrants; hits line drives to all fields and is not afraid to go with pitches the other way; great extension; has shown a propensity to struggle with vertically oriented off-speed pitches and has failed to adjust in several viewings.



Right side: stroke is longer with a tick slower bat speed; load is deeper from the right side; shows more loft through the zone, which causes the bat to be in and out of the zone quickly; will swing and miss more from the right side due to the swing length and a barrel that comes off plane quickly.","Power will come to the gaps in the form of doubles; has plenty of strength, but his swing produces abundant topspin, which is conducive for hard line drives from gap to gap but limits over-the-fence pop; more loft and ability to generate backspin from the right side in BP; further projection is limited due to square block body type.","Speed is not part of his game currently and he does not project to add any due to his maxed frame; 4.33 on a dig from the left side; multiple 4.5s to first base; 8.45 to second base; will continue to slow down with age.","Behind the plate, Caratini has relatively soft hands a developing feel for receiving the ball; raw in the finer points of framing; occasionally goes elbow up on balls to his glove side rather than manipulating hand/wrist position to receive, dragging glove hand out of the zone; decent side-to-side agility and good blocking fundamentals; possesses the raw tools (non-arm) for continued development behind the plate.



At third, Caratini's feet are clunky and his hands are hard; backhand pickup is poor; side-to-side agility is below average; looks robotic charging balls down the line; underwhelming athleticism will put a natural limit on his impact at the hot corner; below average third baseman at the major league level.","Slow release; gets arm up quick but has a slight hitch at the top; throws have a visible hump and die before reaching the second base bag, displaying arm-side tail; pop times range from 2.05-2.20 in games, 2.20-2.35 between innings; while not a weapon, his arm plays better at 3B and would not be exposed in the manner in which it would behind the plate.","55","40","35","45","45"

In my second look, this was the sequence to one right-handed batter: 99 mph fastball with run; 87 mph slider with two-plane break; 99 mph fastball with run on the outside black for strike three. 



The success is coming from his fastball, a true 80-grade offering that plays to its fullest potential, and recently discovered ability to throw strikes. Diaz established the fastball in both outings, throwing it for called strikes. The pitch doesn't flatten out at any velocity, including 99 mph, which is rarity. Establishing the fastball allowed his two other offerings to play up. The slider became a swing-and-miss offering in, as well as outside, the strikezone. He will throw it glove side consistently. The changeup is most pitcher's fastball, and the bottom will fall out at times. 



I would fast track Diaz to the major leagues, because he may be the best reliever in the Angels organization right now. The stuff is major league ready; there's no projection in the body or arsenal, so there's no need to waste bullets in his arm. Move him up one level at a time to see if he can keep throwing strikes with the fastball.","High three-quarters arm slot; works exclusively from the stretch; compact arm action; max effort delivery; unimpeded arm creates violent recoil; 80-grade arm strength; uptempo pitcher; stays on top of the ball well; thick body; will need to be maintained; physically maxed out.","80","Fastball","80","97-99","null","null","High three-quarters arm slot; works exclusively from the stretch; compact arm action; max effort delivery; unimpeded arm creates violent recoil; 80-grade arm strength; uptempo pitcher; stays on top of the ball well; thick body; will need to be maintained; physically maxed out.","null","65","50","null","null","80","65","50","null","null"

The combination of run and heavy action make it a very difficult offering to square up in the lower tier of the zone.  I liked the overall look of the pitch, and feel it’s a fastball that can continue to play at the highest level.  The pitcher is inconsistent finishing his delivery, especially out of the stretch in this outing, and it caused the heater to stay up.  While this particular lineup didn’t do much damage, it’s an area where the pitch tends to be easier to square and better hitters are going to be able to handle it.



I see Sanchez always having to work and fight to reel his fastball in.  First, the right-hander isn’t that great at throwing downhill.  He tends to stay more upright in his delivery, which leads to having trouble staying above the fastball.  This showed inning-to-inning and at times batter-to-batter.  Also, the natural movement of the pitch actually gives him less margin of error.  Sanchez needs to be more precise and consistently account for the movement when trying to spot it.  Overall, I see it more likely that the command hovers around average or so.



In this outing the righty didn’t throw a secondary offering until the 4th inning, but the curveball immediately showed as a premium offering.  The depth and shape of the pitch are excellent, with Sanchez displaying strong feel for it.  I see the potential to miss a lot of bats and neutralize hitters with the curve, along with it to be considered one of the better ones in the league.  His ability to consistently throw it for strikes in different shapes is impressive.  The changeup looked a lot better when thrown to the glove-side.  The action was deeper.  This pitch will be a third offering in Sanchez’s repertoire, but can be viable if strategically worked into sequences.



This pitcher has high-end stuff, and is capable of putting dominant stretches together, especially if he is working down in the zone with his fastball.  I see Sanchez likely to battle inconsistencies due to the aforementioned things above, but having the potential to impact a team as an above-average player over the long haul of a career.  My gut says the upside is a third starter, with the ability to have a career year or two above that.","¾ arm slot; loose, efficient delivery; doesn’t strain to create velocity; fast arm; soft landing; tends to stay high during finish of delivery; inconsistent throwing downhill; quick out of the stretch; short stride – not much lower body.  1.32-1.43 out of stretch; kept focus with men on base; held velocity deep into outing; doesn’t wear himself","60","FB","65","91-95","null","null","¾ arm slot; loose, efficient delivery; doesn’t strain to create velocity; fast arm; soft landing; tends to stay high during finish of delivery; inconsistent throwing downhill; quick out of the stretch; short stride – not much lower body.  1.32-1.43 out of stretch; kept focus with men on base; held velocity deep into outing; doesn’t wear himself","null","70","50","null","null","60","65","45","null","null"

The left-hander touches 94, and while he sits in the low 90's now, he's increased his velocity over the last two years and he could have a little more in the tank if he gets bigger. He knows what he's doing with the curve too, a tight 12-7 bender that he likes to use a chase pitch to get strikeouts. If the changeup comes along, he'll fit nicely in the middle of a big league rotation down the line.



To get there though, Steele has a few hurdles to leap. With a head snap, choppy stride, and moderate spinal tilt, there are command concerns, and on the night that I saw him, he lost all feel for the strike zone twice in three innings. His changeup also has a ways to go, as it's a clear third pitch behind the fastball and curve. 



If the command never improves and the change doesn't develop, Steele could still have a bright future in the bullpen, where the southpaw's best two offerings will play up in short bursts. The Cubs will do everything they can to make it work as a starter, however, and with his athleticism and projectability, they could be rewarded with a mid-rotation arm if it all breaks right.","Average height and build for a starter; athletic frame; high three-quarter delivery; above average plane; drives off straight back leg; straight stride; inconsistent landing spot, choppy stride at times; glove arm lift at onset of delivery helps him hide the ball; ferris wheel arm action; loose arm; good arm speed with fastball and curve; head snap; spinal tilt; finishes square; fell into predictable patterns with rhythm and looks with runners on base.","55","Fastball","60","90-92","null","null","Average height and build for a starter; athletic frame; high three-quarter delivery; above average plane; drives off straight back leg; straight stride; inconsistent landing spot, choppy stride at times; glove arm lift at onset of delivery helps him hide the ball; ferris wheel arm action; loose arm; good arm speed with fastball and curve; head snap; spinal tilt; finishes square; fell into predictable patterns with rhythm and looks with runners on base.","null","55","40","null","null","55","45","30","null","null"

With his strong build and command of three solid pitches, he could project to be a long relief or quality 4 or 5 starter.  He looked focused and intent on executing his game plan and maintained good poise in precarious situations. From the windup he located well with his fast ball and kept hitters off balance with changeup, also mixed in the slider when ahead in the count or to put hitter away on two strike pitch. He did rush (mechanically) a bit for my liking from the stretch, primarily using the slide step.  He was consistently high with his release point with runners on and got hit around when up in the zone.  Despite his strong build, conditioning may be a factor moving forward, but still early in the season.  I thought his pitching IQ was above average in terms of setting up hitters and working the strike zone.  I was very impressed with his poise and he showed no emotion even when things got a bit hairy.  He was able to come back within himself and make pitches to get out of jams and stop the bleeding.  If Asher can work on controlling the running game and maintain good tempo and release point from the stretch, a better projection is possible.

His strengths are his ability to keep hitters off balance to due his pitchability of a three-pitch arsenal and consistently throw strikes. 



However, this player is a fringe major league pitcher. The arsenal will not play in the bullpen and won't be able to turn over a lineup multiple times in the long run to profile in the starting rotation. The fastball plays up due to his control and command, but the changeup plays down as a result. His other offering in the slider lacks bite or explosion when it crosses the plate. I fail to see any projection or true weapon in the arsenal that will allow this player to carve out a niche in the major leagues.","Standard three-quarters arm slot; arm comes lower at times; works from the first base side of the rubber; repeats mechanics well; hides the ball well behind a high leg kick; shortened leg kick out of the stretch; slow arm; compact arm action; gets behind the baseball; lacks explosion; stays tall and balanced until back leg comes through on finish; glove leads; stays closed; throwing hand can float out at front.","35","Fastball","45","86","null","null","Standard three-quarters arm slot; arm comes lower at times; works from the first base side of the rubber; repeats mechanics well; hides the ball well behind a high leg kick; shortened leg kick out of the stretch; slow arm; compact arm action; gets behind the baseball; lacks explosion; stays tall and balanced until back leg comes through on finish; glove leads; stays closed; throwing hand can float out at front.","null","45","45","null","null","35","40","40","null","null"

He physically looks big league ready now and has all the attributes you want in a power starter.  His pre game warmups looked polished, smooth, and consistent.  However, the bullpen did not transfer to game speed.  He looked inconsistent, unsure, and with runners on, very awkward.  He failed to look at baserunners multiple times and was very predictable with his timing in the stretch.  He looked uncomfortable with the slide step, leaving everything up in zone.  He managed to get out of the game with with 0 runs in 4 innings and only 1 hit, but walked 5.  Still only 22, I'd like to see him develop more of a feel for the game and a plan of attack with his fastball.  The lack of command of the FB was bothersome, however it would only be minute mechanical adjustments to do so.  With experience he should mature and grasp the game better.  I'd still keep him around to develop 2-3 more seasons because there is a much higher ceiling achievable for him than where he is at now.","Build: Big, broad, strong frame; athletic looking; strong legs; workhorse type pitchers body

There is some effort to his delivery, which could lead to a relief role, but it wouldn't be an issue if he had a more well-rounded arsenal.



His changeup is below-average and doesn't show a ton of potential for growth. That leaves him with a two-pitch arsenal that will make it tough to remain a starter. Additionally, his slender build puts extra strain on his arm to create his velocity, especially later in outings when his legs tire.



He has a chance to remain a starter if he adds strength in the lower half and can get his change-up to league-average, but those are two major questions for a player who is already 22.

A power arm with a hulking 6-foot-4 frame, Gray is a name everybody knows at this point, and he’s likely to be off the board within the top few picks. The right-hander’s stuff is undeniable; his fastball is at least a 70 pitch, his present slider is an easy 60, and he shows feel for a projected quality changeup. All the tools are there for Gray to become a front-line starter, and he could zoom through the minor leagues, but there is some development needed. Right now, Gray shows a better feel for pitching with his slider than his fastball; he often relies on the overpowering velocity to get by with the heater. That’s not surprising given the success against college hitters, but he’ll need to refine the command. His arm action is fine, but the stiff landing may cause a few more command problems than his current college numbers (22 BB in 119 IP) suggest. On Friday, one day after he’s drafted, you’ll be able to see Gray on ESPN (7:00 p.m. EST) in the NCAA Super Regional against LSU.","3/4 arm slot; big, strong frame with broad shoulders; has the body to handle big starter workload; will have to ensure body doesn’t get out of control down the line; high leg kick; arm itself works very well; clean action; excellent arm speed; stiff front side/landing leg and often falls over it towards first, especially when throwing the fastball.","70","Fastball","70","","null","null","3/4 arm slot; big, strong frame with broad shoulders; has the body to handle big starter workload; will have to ensure body doesn’t get out of control down the line; high leg kick; arm itself works very well; clean action; excellent arm speed; stiff front side/landing leg and often falls over it towards first, especially when throwing the fastball.","null","70","55","null","null","70","60","45","null","null"

Overall, project Webster as a third starter or high-leverage reliever at the major-league level. The stuff is by far good enough to remain as a starter and he can have an arsenal of three plus pitches, but the stamina over the long season and ability to maintain stuff deeper into games is currently a question. Webster almost seems to come out of the gates with too much energy and adrenaline. Part of maturation process will be to manage outings better. I have a tougher time seeing Webster as a 200-plus-inning pitcher year in and year out. He will have to prove his durability and team will likely have to balance wearing him down. Webster’s secondary offerings are well advanced against the level of competition. I feel both the change and slider will continue to miss bats at the next level, but he will use the slider more often earlier in sequences to avoid high quality hitters from jumping on the fastball quickly. Potential to make an All-Star game or two.

The CB is one of the best strikeout pitches I have seen watching minor league games. Both pitches need minor refinement in terms of consistency and command, but they will be weapons in the majors. The CH is further away, and I do not view it as a true weapon by itself. However, it works with the rest of the arsenal and Giolito shows ability to nearly replicate the pitch out of his hand like a fastball. 



Throughout the outing, Giolito displayed his athleticism on the mound, showing excellent PFP skills and ability to become an extra fielder. His arsenal was impressive, but I was nearly as impressed by the makeup on the mound. He gave up a well-hit HR on a 96 mph fastball to Carlos Asuaje in the second, and then decided that was enough for the day and dominated the rest of the outing.



Giolito is a high risk prospect simply for the fact that Tommy John Surgery is on the resume, and the Nationals are making sure he does not become overworked this season. Once the training wheels come off, Giolito will soar high.

In the past, Bridwell would have unraveled in the 1st and 2nd innings when he gave up a few hard hit balls and made a throwing error on a pickoff play. However, he composed himself after a mound visit by the catcher and actually fixed his mechanics during the inning. I have not seen that in the past. Bridwell is showing that he can learn and use that to progress as the game goes on. His stuff fluctuated the entire game due to the mechanical issues, but the stuff is very good when he is at his best. The slider is the most inconsistent pitch this season, as he has lacked efficiency with the pitch in multiple looks. The change has drastically improved and it will carry him at times. With the fastball/change combo, he can work through a lineup even when he lacks fastball command; which is often. If everything clicks, which is a long shot, Bridwell has the arsenal and stamina to be a #3 starter with potential to flash brilliance in spurts.

Very competitive on everything from BP, to not giving away at bats, to taking the extra base.","Extremely thin frame. High waisted.

Will add weight but hard to imagine breaking 200lbs.","It takes time to appreciate the hitting ability Tapia has. You can get thrown off by the body, the stance, or what he is working on in BP that day. Some days in BP you will see him do nothing but hit line drives up the middle or to the left side. Other days he will put on a show and let it fly. No matter what he is doing his swing is very easy, well timed, and balanced. In games he sprays the ball to all fields. His swing is fluid and the ball is coming off his bat hot. His goal is simple at the plate, get the barrel on the ball. He accomplishes this more often than not thanks to an innate ability to manipulate himself and/or his bat to make sure he's squaring up the baseball.","The power could actually play higher as Tapia fills out and adds strength. That being said Tapia will never be known for power and that's almost a compliment. He can put on a show in BP but in games he saves those type of swings for when he is sitting 2-0 or 3-1. He won't give away an at bat seeking to hit a home run and end up flying out. You make a mistake and he will punish it. Tapia is going to hit 300 but if he goes a month without seeing a pitch he can put over the fence then so be it.","From a pure footspeed view Tapia is a 6. 4 seconds down to first base with a solid first step out of the box. His grade gets raised thanks to his base running skills. He is a pest when he's on base. He stealing percentage isn't great currently as he is very hit and miss on his ability to get good jumps. He's at his best when the ball is in play and he's running. He picks up the third base coach early, doesn't waste motion trying to jerk his head around to spot fielders, he can slide around tags. Instincts are incredible.","On any other club he would be a CF but will work in LF for Rockies. He is coming through the minors with David Dahl who is better in CF. Tapia gets good jumps but sometimes you will see him take slow small steps but breaking out into a full run. This could be him just getting used to reading the ball at a corner spot. Doesn't have great top end speed. Everything is good defensively and Tapia's natural athleticism carries him to a 6 grade but nothing is elite.","Quick arm but can get on the side of the ball at times and throw sinkers from the outfield. Arm is just fringe right now but I like the mechanics and I like the arm speed. Gets rid of the ball quick for an outfielder. Will never be strong enough for RF but plays well in left and center.","70","50","70","60","50"

The lefty was willing to work both sides of the plate with his fastball, along with showing no fear in trying to get the pitch up under right-handed hitters' hands.  There was a lack of execution, however, especially in the 3rd inning of the outing.  It was compounded by Rodriguez losing his rhythm, and what seemed to be some focus in slowing the game down.  The pitcher went into an ultra-attack mode, where he was trying to hard to force the execution of his pitches and it lead to a loss of control over the outing.



Rodriguez's fastball is the type that is best served being thrown in the lower tier of the strike zone and on the corners.  The pitcher needs work improving the consistency of his fastball command to limit hard contact and continue to progress through the upper minors.  There's a fine line with the pitch.  Presently, neither of his secondary offerings are of the bat missing variety.  I saw his slider as having the best potential to progress towards this level.  Rodriguez feels the pitch well and shows the ability to throw it for strikes.  The lack of hard bite is a hurdle now for getting opposing batters to commit early to the pitch and swing over the top of it.  The way he threw the pitch lead me to believe it can tighten up a bit more with further repetition over the next year or so.  The changeup can be a serviceable offering for him in the long-run, but I didn't see the feel for it getting past an average offering.



Overall, this isn't a flashy arm or one with top shelf stuff.  I did like the way Rodriguez went about trying to execute his craft.  The lefty had an idea of who he is as a pitcher.  But, there are rough edges here and limitations when laying in the present stuff against major-league hitters.  His body language and overall demeanor left me with the impression that the mind is in the right place to make progress, and more repetition will drive future growth to reach the projection.","3/4 arm slot; evenly filled out body; easy, repeatable delivery; smooth and efficient; uses frame to create leverage and plane; gets on top of the ball; throws downhill; can drift with feet during finish; quick to plate - 1.29-1.34 out of stretch.","55","Fastball","55","89-92","null","null","3/4 arm slot; evenly filled out body; easy, repeatable delivery; smooth and efficient; uses frame to create leverage and plane; gets on top of the ball; throws downhill; can drift with feet during finish; quick to plate - 1.29-1.34 out of stretch.","null","55","50","null","null","55","50","45","null","null"

It has been a long journey for the RHP, but he looks to be mostly back in form. The velocity may never return to 94-98. but I do expect another slight tick in velocity from 91-94. It likely does not happen this season. Regardless, he still has a terrific arsenal.



Bundy is one of the most polished pitchers in the minors, displaying an extraordinary amount of pitchability, confidence and cognizance on the mound. While many will look at the arsenal and say this is not the same pitcher, I still believe the intense makeup and pitchability boost Bundy up the charts. This is one of the most competitive players I have seen, even against competition like the NYPL. Bundy did not care where he was, he wanted to annihilate every hitter with his arsenal.



Bundy is still an extremely talented arm regardless if the velocity returns, the CT returns to its old form, and the CH gains its full effectiveness. With his pitches still grading out as plus or potentially plus, Bundy has a deep arsenal that will help him work through a Major League lineup when one of his pitches is off for the night. The CB is currently the best secondary offering, but the CT has potential to be that pitch down the road if the velocity and crispness of it returns. Bundy is going to pitch and pitch well in the majors. However, there is some mild risk here simply because he has Tommy John on the record and the arsenal has not quite reached its past potential.

Despite the extended layoffs, Borucki is advanced for a pitcher in short season ball. He lives around the edges of the plate with all three pitches, and while he can sometimes err towards the side of caution when attacking hitters, he rarely makes a mistake in the zone. He can throw his fastball and both secondaries for strikes, and he showed advanced pitchability: you just don't see too many starters who can add and subtract velocity on their fastball or depth on their curve at this level. 



If Borucki can stay healthy, the Jays could have a mid-rotation starter on their hands, although it looks like the organization will be taking it slowly with him. He’s still building up arm strength — he didn’t make it out of the third inning and his average fastball velocity was quite a bit lower than his highest readings — but both his slight build and injury history suggest that he’s unlikely to develop into a workhorse.

This will allow him to regain true 2012 form and we should see the sitting velocity, of all his pitches, jump. 



Bundy showed a present advanced arsenal and it was hard to believe this was the same guy I saw struggle last season. Along with his Fastball, Change-up, Curveball, his once devastating Cutter is now more of a slider-like pitch. With overall improvement in command and strength building, Bundy shows the future arsenal is a top-of-the-rotation quality arm once again. These are things that will come back to Bundy as he pitches this year and we should see him in Baltimore's rotation in the near future.

At his peak, he should offer some doubles power, but will never be a big over-the-fence contributor. His aggressiveness at the plate can be improved upon with age, but is also a part of his mentality as a player and thus likely doesn't have a ton of room for growth. That aggressiveness limits his swing utility and should ultimately cause him to be a down-in-the-order hitter unless he proves to have better contact skills than he's presently showing.



Rosario is a fantastic shortstop, which will be enough to carry him to the big leagues. He has a chance to be a plus defender at a premium position, and will be able to remain at the position for the majority of his career. That lowers the bar on his bat, which should be good enough to be an everyday player but won't be of the impact variety. With his defense, that won't matter.



The common assumption is that he will add weight onto his thin frame as he grows, but his narrow shoulders and slight build don't allow for much room for growth. This isn't a player who is going to fill out significantly and pack on substantial pounds.

It is not, however, his only tool. The power profile is limited, though it's due primarily to his leadoff/line-drive approach at the plate. He could likely hit for slightly more power if he was willing to swing and miss more and sacrifice a few points on his batting average, but it's not his game. His patient approach at the plate constantly produces long, pitch-eating at-bats and he embraces the role.



In the field, Meadows is a good enough outfielder to handle center field. His speed isn't at the elite level you'd like from a center fielder, but he makes up for it with good jumps and strong instincts. He has enough speed to handle center field and should be able to stay there until he ages out of the position, unless he puts on a significant amount of weight and loses a step. 



The overall profile is similar to that of Christian Yelich, with a contact-oriented approach that leads to high batting averages, strong on-base skills and just enough power (mostly in the form of doubles) to keep pitchers honest. It's a definite big league profile and one that should make for an every day outfielder.","Tall thin frame, ideal for adding weight, which he will need to do; not weak but hasn't filled out yet.

Cons: Doesn't use lower half, no weight transfer in swing; does not look to drive the ball, line drive approach.","Limited power profile, sacrifices power for contact; will run into a few home runs because of size, has strong wrists that will generate some pull-side power; approach at the plate limits power more than anything; does have good gap/doubles power and should post strong totals, but over-the-fence power is limited.","4.1 to first base; quick-twitch athlete, long strides; takes a few steps to get to full speed but then glides fluidly.","Good jumps, quick first step, limited wasted movement; glides gracefully towards the ball; smooth, effortless routes; won't be an elite center fielder due to lack of elite speed, but has enough speed and athleticism to handle it in his twenties; gets the most out of his abilities in the field.","Below-average arm strength, enough for center field but will limit him to left field if he has to move to a corner.","60","40","60","55","40"

As he continues to get a feel for his delivery, the changeup could reach that projection. Plus makeup and work ethic to get it there.



While I give him a chance to start, I'm skeptical that he will be able to hit his upside. A realistic role for him would be as a high leverage reliever in the backend of a bullpen, where he can pump his fastball from 95-97 mph with his lethal curveball. This is his realistic scenario because the life and command his offerings project as below-average; best I can see is 45-grade in both scenarios. The command won't be there due to the violent head whack and lengthy arm action, though it does allow for his stuff to be as good as it is.



The floor is that of a quality reliever. I think he could pitch in a bullpen right now, actually, because of how good the pure stuff is.

Overall, project Workman as a seventh/eighth inning reliever, with a set-up man ceiling. The pitcher has a chance to continue starting in the near term and at the very least get a shot at Triple-A, but I feel he is best suited for relief over the long run. Workman has made strides improving his fastball command, which showed in this outing. He consistently hit the target in the lower tier of the strike zone and avoided working elevated too often. He had an easier time hitting spots glove side than arm side. Workman’s fastball tended to get away from him in that spot due to the way he releases the ball. I was impressed with the amount of swings and misses he got with the heater, but it was a very weak Double-A lineup. I don’t think he’ll be able to churn through an advanced lineup without having his secondary stuff, which was very inconsistent in this start. Workman’s curve showed some flashes, but he struggled snapping it off and staying on top of it. The pitcher does expend some extra energy during his delivery and wear down when he labors. The mechanics and arm action can get jerky as well, although in this outing things were smoother. For me, Workman’s stuff has a chance to play up well in a relief role. While his stuff is good, the secondary stuff is on the inconsistent side and shorter outings may allow him to strip down to what is working. It is a good sign he is making progress at the level. I will be interesting to see how Workman handles making adjustments now that lineups are seeing him for the second time.","¾ arm slot; shorter with arm action; effort in the delivery; some jerk and head snap; improvement becoming smoother; balanced motion; uses body to finish; expends extra energy; body to handle rigors of the position and the long baseball season; not the best of feet, but lands soft enough.","60","Fastball","60","90-94","null","null","¾ arm slot; shorter with arm action; effort in the delivery; some jerk and head snap; improvement becoming smoother; balanced motion; uses body to finish; expends extra energy; body to handle rigors of the position and the long baseball season; not the best of feet, but lands soft enough.","null","55","60","null","null","60","50","55","null","null"

The fastball did not quite reach the ceiling that was displayed in my first look, but it was still an excellent pitch capable of dominating at higher levels. The CB is a true elite offering, with only slight release point issues as the main concern. The CB is one of the best pitches in the minors and he shows extreme confidence in the offering.



His CH was thrown more in this outing, and it was clear he was working on this pitch throughout the entire outing. In certain cases, he went to the CH instead of the CB to finish off a batter. For progression as a pitcher, this was important for me to see. It is clear that the CB is going to play at the higher levels, but Giolito was able to flash the CH and show that this pitch can be effective when it is consistent. The CH needs more refinement, but the ability is there and slight improvements were noted from my last viewing.



Giolito is a competitor on the mound, and you can generally see the emotions on the rubber. He wants to be perfect out there, but he does not let it phase him when somethings does not go his way. I like his pitchability and competitiveness, and I think once the training wheels completely come off, he will fly through the minors. He still has not built up his stamina, but remember this is a pitcher coming off TJS and it is the latter half of the season now. 



Overall, this is a potential front-line starter with a chance to be one of the better pitchers in the game.

He's huge, and his size helps him generate easy velocity and thus command his fastball well. With hard two-seam movement, premium velocity and average present command, it's a legitimate plus pitch with the potential to be even better.



Unfortunately, that's about all he has. A cutter is Coshow's second potential average offering, and the inverse movement works well to off-set the arm-side action on the two-seam fastball. But he doesn't throw anything soft for hitters to have to worry about, and better hitters will exploit him by cheating on the fastball to catch up with the velocity.



Given the potential of his two-seamer/cutter combination, he needs only an average off-speed offering of some kind to keep hitters honest. There's not a lot of hope for him ever developing a truly effective one, but if he can get one of his off-speed pitches to an average level, he could really succeed in a bullpen role. He's working as a starter for the first time as a professional, but he's likely destined to end up back in the bullpen.","Uses height well; easy delivery, little effort; average arm speed, some stiffness to arm action; shoulder does most of the work; generated good downward plane; has a high effective velocity because of plus extension towards the plate.","60","FB","70","93-96","null","null","Uses height well; easy delivery, little effort; average arm speed, some stiffness to arm action; shoulder does most of the work; generated good downward plane; has a high effective velocity because of plus extension towards the plate.","null","50","40","40","null","60","45","30","30","null"

He allowed three homers and a number of hard hit balls, and was fighting his composure by the end of the outing. There were mitigating circumstances -- travel day, wet weather, poor mound quality -- but he had bad command from the first inning. 



Still, there were positives to glean. He's capable of throwing four pitches for strikes, three of which flashed at least average. He also has the right blend of simple mechanics and athleticism to project improvement in his ability to pitch to specific spots in the strike zone. Looking into the future, he fits best as an innings eating No. 5 or a swingman who can throw multiple innings out of the bullpen. His arsenal isn't designed to attack lefties specifically -- the changeup is his best offering and it keeps lefties honest -- and he'll be at his most valuable over longer stretches, instead of as a LOOGY or short reliever.","Simple, repeatable delivery; high three-quarters arm slot; tight leg lift; strides slightly towards first; back remains upright during stride, giving him downhill plane on his offerings; average arm speed; consistent arm speed on all offerings; head remains still and focused on the target throughout motion; finishes square and in a good position to field; slight body, room to add weight.","45","Fastball","50","89","null","null","Simple, repeatable delivery; high three-quarters arm slot; tight leg lift; strides slightly towards first; back remains upright during stride, giving him downhill plane on his offerings; average arm speed; consistent arm speed on all offerings; head remains still and focused on the target throughout motion; finishes square and in a good position to field; slight body, room to add weight.","null","55","50","45","null","45","45","45","30","null"

His floor is lower than his fellow pitching prospects in the Orioles system, Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman. But Hunter Harvey was amped to go against fellow top pitching prospect Giolito. His fastball was explosive out of his hand and got on hitters quickly. He generates easy velocity from plus arm speed and a clean delivery.  He would bust righties inside with 94 then cut it away at 91 with the fastball. His curveball is a true hammer and will be a weapon at the highest level. The changeup is a work in progress but I trust the development of it because of the arm action. The overall command profile needs refinement but Harvey has the skill set and determination to do that. The things that stood out to me the most were Harvey’s demeanor and mentality. He kept cool and collected but was pissed when he gave up the hit and hit the two batters. Not to the extent of it being inappropriate but at the point where he was mad at himself for not blowing it by the hitter. Also, he has a killer instinct on the mound. He has a “here it is, come and hit it” mentality and that’s what I want from a pitcher.

His control/command issues weren’t a huge factor in the start because of his plus-plus heater and his ability to fool hitters with his consistent arm speed. There is concern that Greene only has two usable pitches and would be most effective as a late-inning reliever. He would be a potential closer at the big-league level, however, I’m buying into him as a starting pitcher. His fastball makes up for his inconsistent offspeed command and his change has the potential to be above average, especially with the problems it would give hitters when it works off of his fastball.

His flaws, however, will likely make him a reliever, though he could be very good one.



He's not a great athlete, which limits his ability to control his body and repeat his mechanics. That leads to major questions about whether or not he'll ever be able to have enough command to start. Additionally, his changeup is no where near where it needs to be in order to be a usable third major league offering.



On the plus side, however, his combination of fastball velocity and bat-missing slider could make him a high-leverage reliever. In order to pitch in the late innings, he'll have to continue to improve the command of his slider, which he can use to attack righties when he is able to keep it down in the zone. With that combination and some additional fastball command, he could be a high-leverage arm. If the command never gets to that level, he should still be a highly effective situational reliever who makes a career out of dominating left-handed hitters.","Plus arm speed; above-average length to arm path, drops down out of hand break; doesn't use size as well as he could during leg raise/gather at top of delivery; inconsistent timing of arm and explosion towards plate, arm drags behind body at times.","50","FB","60","91-94","null","null","Plus arm speed; above-average length to arm path, drops down out of hand break; doesn't use size as well as he could during leg raise/gather at top of delivery; inconsistent timing of arm and explosion towards plate, arm drags behind body at times.","null","60","30","null","null","50","55","20","null","null"

He pitched out of a couple jams, going with his plus-plus changeup in big spots to limit the damage. Unfortunately, he wasn't quite right in his last handful of outings in August  and was placed on the 7-day DL. Guillon had a ton of upside even up until this season, but the fastball that was up to 97 mph hasn't resurfaced and settled more in the low 90's. With that speed, the command needs to be that much better and it simply wasn't in this start. The body, changeup, and left-handedness all scream to give him more time to develop, but lots of questions loom. Can he remain healthy with Tommy John surgery already on his resume? Can he regain his fastball velocity? Will his command take a big step forward? I'm pessimistic that any of these come to fruition, but I still think he can progress enough to reach the big leagues as a reliever with that changeup and two other solid offerings.

However, all the moving parts within his mechanics make it hard for him to repeat his arm slot for five innings. Finding a consistency and being able to repeat in the long-term will be the key.

While Santana throws strikes, his delivery makes it hard for him to command well within the zone and often leaves his fastball in places that more advanced hitters will crush.

If Santana is able to improve his command a grade despite the delivery issues and continues to improve on the consistency of both his slider and changeup, he has a chance to stick in a rotation, but it's more likely that the command issues will force him to settle for a role in the middle of a bullpen.","Santana stays upright throughout most of his delivery.

I was not impressed by his pitchability, often wondering what his plan was on the mound. It seems like he was mostly working on the FB/CH combo, but both pitches are currently erratic and easy to barrel when left up in the zone.



The risk is high for Johansen as a starter, because he will need to tighten up all three pitches to provide a consistent package.

However, the cut at the lower velo band was the most intriguing aspect of his arsenal.

In the first look, the fastball velocity was well down from his usual range. The velocity returned in the second outing, hitting 97, but had a thumb injury. No injuries or other reasons for a poor third start, so the grades are from that look. 



The player's struggled to make adjustments to professional baseball. I don't blame the tandem rotation, as he's been on extended rest in each of my looks, and he's started each of them rather than coming out of  the bullpen. After each of the poor outings, the player never shows emotion when he's on the mound or when being pulled -- just takes a seat in the dugout as if nothing happened. I don't mind players that don't wear their heart on their sleeve, but he pitches like it's a bullpen session where he just needs to get his work in, grooving in pitches with no purpose. 



It is worth noting that only one secondary offering would show up in each of his starts. Also, hitters did not have trouble squaring up his fastball whatsoever. That may always be the case because he just doesn't have deception in his delivery. But he does tip his offerings with his wrist placement; recommend keeping an eye on his stretch vs. windup splits. 



Right now, the player just doesn't look like the player he was drafted to be. I haven't seen anything to even consider he could be a No. 2 starter, or even more. I'm concerned more with how he pitches than what his fastball is registering on the radar gun.

The velocity matches the description, with a low-to-mid 90's fastball coming out with virtually no effort in the delivery. The command is below average, as he presently throws a ton of bad strikes. With his combination of velocity and strong downward plane, however, the lack of command is the only thing keeping it from being a plus pitch.



The same can be said about his slider, which flashed the ability to tie up right-handed hitters but severely lacked consistency. He simply didn't throw nearly enough of them for strikes for hitters to have to worry about. It's another potential plus pitch, but the gap between present utility and ceiling is large. His change-up doesn't have the same ceiling as the slider, with too far to go and not as good of a feel for the pitch, but it does generate some movement, which gives it a chance to have some utility.



Despite being in his fifth professional season, Jenkins still lacks experience and it shows. The package shows the potential for a mid-rotation starter if the change-up can develop into something hitters have to factor in, but more likely is a role as a reliever. The slider could be a real weapon against right-handed hitters if he can be more consistent with it, and he has the potential to add a few ticks of velocity to his fastball if he puts a little more effort in his delivery in short stints. All of that adds up to a potential reliever, and if he does end up with two plus pitches, he could find himself in high-leverage situations.","High leg kick, knee all the way to chin; loose arm action; tall frame, ideal pitcher's body; creates great downward plane; throws with little to no effort in delivery.","50","Fastball","60","92-94","null","null","High leg kick, knee all the way to chin; loose arm action; tall frame, ideal pitcher's body; creates great downward plane; throws with little to no effort in delivery.","null","60","50","null","null","50","45","40","null","null"

Throughout the start, he stayed on top of the ball and was able to replicate his release point with the majority of his heaters.  This enabled Owens to throw to spots in the lower tier of the strike zone, where the plane he created forced hitters to get on top of the ball.  



While the pitcher did get some swings-and-misses when elevated with his fastball, I don't see the pitch being effective in this area against big league hitters.  Owens is deceptive overall, with the ball seaming to jump out of his body at the last instance, but he's likely to get hurt often working in this area.  I do have some concerns about how the fastball is going to play if this was a peak representation of the command.  



Owens' changeup showed as his best pitch in this outing.  There's plenty of fastball guise, and hitters consistently swung over the top of it.  My feel is that this offering will continue to play as the lefty advances further.  The deception, along with the separation in velocity, will force even the better of hitters to commit early.  Owens' sprinkled his curveball in towards the end of the start, and I'm not big on the present look of the pitch.  The lack of power will give major league hitters a chance to recover even when they have committed early.



Owens will need to demonstrate solid-average-to-plus command of his fastball on a consistent basis to fully reach his ceiling.  In this outing, it looked like the pitcher was focusing hard on finishing his delivery and working down in the zone.  The execution showed.  There is a finer margin of error here given the profile of the overall repertoire.  On nights when Owens' fastball is just a bit off, it is likely to be difficult.  I see the prospect over the long-haul projecting towards the back of a rotation, where he can provide a lot of innings and value as a reliable, complimentary piece of a good staff.","Easy delivery; low energy expending; loose thrower; 3/4 arm slot; across body delivery; soft front foot landing; ball comes out of body late; long arm enables leverage when locked into release point; can release early when landing isn't in sync with arm; lot of body to control.","50","Fastball","55","89-91","null","null","Easy delivery; low energy expending; loose thrower; 3/4 arm slot; across body delivery; soft front foot landing; ball comes out of body late; long arm enables leverage when locked into release point; can release early when landing isn't in sync with arm; lot of body to control.","null","60","50","null","null","50","60","45","null","null"

The makeup is plus; he's light and flowing with positive energy, but he's cold-blooded with a mean-streak on the inside.



Realistically, he could be a No. 3 starter with more control than command and a solid-average curveball as his third offering. There's optimism for No. 2 starter potential, because he's shown tremendous feel for his arsenal with limited experience on the mound. To get there, he'll need to tighten up his command and continue making strides with the curveball. 



There's moderate risk with Shipley, because of the projection in the curveball and command. He'll also take longer than some other college arms because of his limited mound experience. But I'm not going to bet against someone as athletic as Shipley. There's no reason he can't tighten up his command with more experience on the mound.

His next at-bat, runners at 1B and 2B, he laid off a plus-plus CH (one of the best Almonte threw all night) just off the plate, fading away. I anticipated Gallo was going to swing out of his shoes but he took it. He then took a strike on the outer part of the plate, which was a pitch he could drove but chose to be patient. Almonte threw him a CH down and Gallo sat on it and drove it through the hole in between 1B-2B hitting behind the runners. His last at-bat against Almonte, Almonte tried to come inside with 95. FB had heavy sink and started at Gallo’s hip and ended up on the inside corner. I saw Gallo shuffle out of the way of this pitch before.

The FB/CB combo is one of the better duo's in the minors, but the CH still has a long ways to go before he becomes consistent enough to start at the highest level.



A ton of projection is left here, with his growth into his skinny frame likely meaning he adds on a tick in velocity down the road. This could help benefit his FB and CH, making them become better future weapons. Harvey is dominant in the Low-A level, but the CH will likely need to become more consistent before he is able to handle the next two levels. He does rely on the CB too much, which is not surprising considering its plus-plus potential and the confidence he has throwing it.



If everything clicks with Harvey, this is a front-line starter that could be one of the better pitchers in the game. He is far from that at this current time, with a high amount of growth left.

His raw strength and collegiate polish are a recipe for exactly the kind of Herculean numbers he's produced thus far, and we're not going to be able to draw too many conclusions about the central question of his power utility until he gets challenged by better sequencing and fastball execution at higher levels. 



Still, it's very much worth confirming that the bat looks very good. It's a three-true-outcome profile, and there will be ample swing-and-miss in his game thanks to a load that can get sloppy and modest bat speed. But Reed's approach is among the more advanced I've seen in the league and he shows a rare ability among hitters with his kind of raw power to get to it in games. He demonstrates a good kind of patience, working counts well and attacking with a selective aggression. He's not passive and will jump fastballs early in counts while also showing encouraging discipline in laying off heaters in the tougher-to-reach corners of the zone. 



The intelligence in the box pairs well with top-shelf brute strength to offset some of the physical limitations Reed's large frame presents, and the combination gives his light-tower power the opportunity to play. I'm bullish he can continue to bring a sizeable chunk of the power into games against advanced pitching and produce value despite a fringy defensive profile. The production will get discounted for the time being on account of league and ballpark context, but Reed has legitimate impact offensive potential and projects as a potential middle-of-the-order bat in a good lineup.","Behemoth; physically maxed-out 6'4"", 240 pounds; big boy strength, barrel-chested with broad, thick shoulders, wide base; Ruthian gait; sneaky coordination and athleticism despite limited mobility and dexterity.","High","2017","55","50/second-division 1B/DH, power bat off the bench","Primary Position: 1B","Secondary Position: DH","Behemoth; physically maxed-out 6'4"", 240 pounds; big boy strength, barrel-chested with broad, thick shoulders, wide base; Ruthian gait; sneaky coordination and athleticism despite limited mobility and dexterity.","Wide base, balanced crouch with loose hands high to back ear and east/west waggle; indirect path on longish load takes an inconsistent shape; hands bob into rhythmic wrist-cock, back-end length to trigger point; doesn't repeat load well, barrel delivery can wander; short stride, generates significant torque and separation with front shoulder, will bar front arm when he over-extends; polished approach, disciplined in and out of zone, evident plan of attack when he offers in different quadrants; demonstrated ability to work up the middle and to left-center with toned-down swing; hangs in against same-handed pitching, tracks spin well; fringe-average raw hit tool projection plays up with strong walk rate and OBP profile.","Raw is double-plus, BP sessions are shows of force; elite strength, bat speed limited to above-average by slower hips and long rotation from deep coil; extends early, looks to drive on the outer half; LCF power alley, strength to muscle the ball out without flush contact; can turn on inner-third velocity; advanced ability to get himself into position to maximize game power.","Three clocks at 4.48, 4.36, and 4.44; can generate a head of steam under way, well below-average pick-up and foot speed; takes good angles rounding first on doubles.","Below-average at present; moves decently around the bag with some notable mobility given size; below-average lateral quickness, footwork is raw, slow into cross-over; range is limited, solid hands on balls he can reach, handles short-hops.","Plenty of arm strength, pure velocity may be 65; poor body control throwing on the move; slow to get into throwing position, footwork lags; potential for above-average utility with additional reps.","50","65","30","45","55"

In the first few innings, he worked 95-97 with the fastball and had trouble locating the pitch, walking a few hitters, and struggling to hit the corners. As the game progressed, he noticeably -- and I believe intentionally -- reduced his velocity, but had more success working his fastball around the plate, which allowed him to get into favorable counts to unleash his slider while occasionally rearing back for more on the fastball when he wanted a whiff. 



While Gray has the stuff to dominate opponents, he lacks the command and feel for pitching that would allow him to take full advantage of his raw arsenal. He's loose in the zone at peak velocity and he sacrifices some of his ability to miss bats when operating at less than full steam. He may also struggle against left-handed batters, as the changeup is inconsistent and generally doesn't offer bat missing drop or fade. 



Ultimately, Gray has the body of a workhorse and the raw stuff to get by without above average command. If his command improves, he could headline the Rockies rotation for years to come. At this point though, it looks more likely that he'll wind up as a slightly above average innings eater than a top of the rotation arm.","Workhorse frame, physically maxed out, big shoulders, large legs; 3/4 arm slot; big leg kick; loose arm, clean arm action; fast arm speed; crossfire delivery; inconsistent landing spot; stable head; prone to missing down below the zone; delivery times: 1.33-1.46.","60","Fastball","60","90-92","null","null","Workhorse frame, physically maxed out, big shoulders, large legs; 3/4 arm slot; big leg kick; loose arm, clean arm action; fast arm speed; crossfire delivery; inconsistent landing spot; stable head; prone to missing down below the zone; delivery times: 1.33-1.46.","null","55","45","null","null","60","55","45","null","null"

			Born: 07/01/1992 (Age: 21)","Bats: Right","Throws: Right","Height: 6' 4""","Weight: 215","New Hampshire Fisher Cats (AA, Blue Jays)","60","No 3 Starter","2015","The quality of Sanchez's raw stuff, mainly his fastball and curveball in this outing, jumped out immediately.  I liked the way the pitcher doesn't waste much energy or strain to generate fastball velocity, along with the type of run and bore the offering shows.  It's a fastball that is more than capable of missing barrels when located properly due to the heavy action in conjunction with high velocity.  



I do have concerns about the pitcher's present fastball command and future growth of this area, and reflected that in the grade.  While Sanchez is athletic and a loose thrower, he doesn't finish his delivery well and has trouble consistently staying out in front of the pitch.  I didn't see any trouble with his landing or staying square to the plate.  It was more in the pace of his delivery when releasing his fastball, which slightly varied at the tail end than when throwing his other offerings.  My feel is that this aspect of his game is always going to be inconsistent and a battle to maintain over the long-run.



What's interesting is that Sanchez showed no problem with his curveball.  In fact, his command of the offering was like night and day from his heater.  The curve displayed excellent spin and very tight rotation.  And, Sanchez also varied the shape with ease depending on the situation.  It's the type of pitch you'd like to see thrown 30 times a game as opposed to relegated to a 1 inning role.  Well above-average is within the reach.  It should get major-league hitters out with frequency.  



The changeup was mostly an afterthought in this outing and only delivered a handful of times.  Based on the way it was thrown without a ton of trust, I can guess that the pitcher has likely handled the low minors with his fastball-curve combo.  More usage of this offering in sequences, or at the very least showing it earlier, is necessary to have sustained success in a starter's role.



I saw front-line type of stuff, but some ways to go when it comes to polish and evolving into a pitcher.  The overall grade reflects my belief that the gap will not be fully closed in the key developmental areas outlined above, which will cause the stuff to play down against premium hitters.","3/4 arm slot; loose, efficient delivery; fast arm; uneven pace -- tends to speed up at tail end; lands square towards home plate; front foot can slightly drift towards first base; keeps head on target; inconsistent keeping arm out in front with fastball -- leads to inconsistent release and lack of finish; minimal lower body incorporation.","60","Fastball","65","89-95","null","null","3/4 arm slot; loose, efficient delivery; fast arm; uneven pace -- tends to speed up at tail end; lands square towards home plate; front foot can slightly drift towards first base; keeps head on target; inconsistent keeping arm out in front with fastball -- leads to inconsistent release and lack of finish; minimal lower body incorporation.","null","70","50","null","null","60","65","45","null","null"

Urena's delivery is relatively free and easy with few, if any, red flags, helping with the overall command projection. His arm gets vertical very quickly in his motion, however, giving hitters a very long look at the ball and decreasing the overall deception therein. The fastball is easy gas and he can pump a lively mid-90s heater with regularity and shows an ability to spot it up on the corners or blow it by hitters up in the zone. Despite a lack of plane, this pitch should be a plus offering at the highest level. The changeup headlines the secondary arsenal and should play to average at the highest level, while the slider and curveball are fringy to below average, respectively. The current lack of big strikeout numbers should continue as he reaches the big leagues due to an underwhelming secondary arsenal.  



As a player who has seen success in AA, Urena's risk of reaching his #4 starter potential is moderate and is tempered by the concern that he ends up in the bullpen with the lack of a swing-and-miss secondary pitch. If the secondaries improve slightly (new grips, etc.), Urena has a better chance of sticking in the rotation. If not, he will slot in nicely as a late-innings relief reliever due to a fastball that will likely tick up beyond the mid-90s in short stints and an average changeup that will work in his favor against lefties.","Very slender frame; thin lower half; broad shoulders; frame could hold more weight down the line; quick-paced drop-and-drive delivery; plane can suffer as a result; arm action is very quick; breaks hands at the letters and gets arm up too early, showing it to hitters for an extended period; increases visibility and decreases deception; arm action is very similar to Randall Delgado's; three-quarters arm slot; loose, whippy arm decelerates well; plus arm speed; long stride down the mound; front leg steps over an imaginary block during stride (aids in velocity); plus momentum; lands on heel; landing can be a bit loud on occasion; back leg is off the rubber at release; pitches over front side decently; falls off toward third base—slightly rotational.

He showed all four of his pitches as well as an intriguing combination of stuff and size, but had absolutely no command of his arsenal.



In my second viewing, he found more success in the box score, but the stuff from his first start may have actually been better. He had several issues in the second start; letting his emotions get to him after plays didn't go his way, constantly missing glove side, and overthrowing. His secondary offerings became firm, including the changeup that registered in the upper-80s in this look.



After these two starts, I haven't seen enough to believe this player can stick in a starting rotation.  Instead, I see him becoming a power reliever in a bullpen, where a team can let his arm loose for an inning. 



While he can hold his velocity, he's clearly more comfortable out of the stretch. I don't think he'll ever be able to hit glove side due to his delivery. The overthrowing won't allow for development of the changeup, or for answering reliability questions. Lastly, it may be best for him to pocket the curveball, allowing him to work on the aforementioned issues rather than working on throwing all four offerings at High-A.","Over-the-top arm slot; arm is quick and loose; arm action can get lengthy; shows ball in the backside; long stride; slow delivery that takes time to develop; can get off-tempo; inconsistent finish; more comfortable out of the stretch; physical body to handle big workloads; loses composure whenever a close play on the bases doesn't go his way.","60","Fastball","60","93","null","null","Over-the-top arm slot; arm is quick and loose; arm action can get lengthy; shows ball in the backside; long stride; slow delivery that takes time to develop; can get off-tempo; inconsistent finish; more comfortable out of the stretch; physical body to handle big workloads; loses composure whenever a close play on the bases doesn't go his way.","null","60","40","40","null","60","55","40","40","null"
